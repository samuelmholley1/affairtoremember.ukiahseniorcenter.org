# Google Sheets API Integration - Production Setup Guide

## Quick Start for Production

Once you have completed the development setup in `GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_SETUP.md`, follow these steps for production deployment:

### 1. Vercel Environment Variables

In your Vercel project dashboard, add these environment variables:

```
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_actual_spreadsheet_id
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour private key here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUCTION_API_URL=https://your-domain.com/api/auction-donations
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPONSORSHIP_API_URL=https://your-domain.com/api/table-sponsors
```

**Important**: Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual Vercel domain.

### 2. API Endpoints

The following endpoints are now available:

- **Auction Donations**: `/api/auction-donations`
- **Table Sponsorships**: `/api/table-sponsors`

### 3. Testing the Integration

1. **Local Testing**: 
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/auction-donations`
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/table-sponsors`
   - Submit test forms to verify they appear in your Google Sheet

2. **Production Testing**: After deployment, test both forms on your live site

### 4. Google Sheet Structure

Make sure your Google Sheet "AATR DONATION DATA" has exactly these tab names and headers:

**Tab 1: "Auction Donations"**
- Headers in Row 1: Timestamp, Name, Email, Phone, Address, Item Description, Estimated Value, Pickup Required, Special Instructions, Contact Preference, Submission ID, IP Address, User Agent, Status

**Tab 2: "Table Sponsorships"**
